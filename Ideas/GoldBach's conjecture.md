# GoldBach's conjecture

Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

Prime number is can expressed to " ab + 1 "

Even number is can expressed to " 2k + 1 + 1"

The sum of two prime number is expressed to

" (ab +1 ) + (ab +1) " 

= 2ab + 1 + 1


threfore,

Prime number ( 2k + 1 + 1) is equal to the sum of two prime number ( 2ab + 1 + 1).
